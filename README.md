1. DDS is the diseases semantic similarity matrix, MMS is the miRNAs similarity functional matrix, M is the known miRNA-disease associations.
2. Similarity is used to calculated the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity, and integrate the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity into DDS and MMSã€‚
3. reSimilarity is used to recalculate the similarity of miRNAs.
4. normFun1 is used to normalize DDS and MMs.
5. BiRWHMDA is the code of unbalance bi-random walk on heterogeneous network. The associations probability matrix will be obtained by inputting the diseases similarity, the miRNAs similarity and the known miRNA-disease associations.
6. main_HeatS_ProbS and HeatS_ProbS_recommendations are the code of hybrid recommendation algorithm. The miRNA-disease transition probability matrix is obtained by inputting the known miRNA-disease associations. 
7. FivefoldcrossValidation is the code of five-fold cross-validation. For a given, the known miRNA-disease association is divided into five equal subset by inputting the number of i from 1 to 22.
8. Roc _curve is used to calculate the AUC value.
9. repition is used to repeat five-fold cross-validation 100 times, and finally get the average AUC of 100 five-fold cross-validation.

Running the main function of repition will directly obtain the AUC of 22 disease that associated with at least 60 miRNAs.
